# SerialMastermind
This project was developed in the Fall of 2019 to support the ICS3U introduction to Serial Communication.
This project is based loosely on the *Mastermind* board game from the 1970s.
A custom PCB appliance game board is inserted into each of two players' Arduino UNOs. Each players own secret code consisting of a sequence of three colours displayed on 
each of the three RGB LEDs. The code is visible to the player but shrouded from sight by the opponent.
